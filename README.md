### **Title: Deciphering Tumor-Associated Macrophage Heterogeneity Through Single Nucleus RNA Sequencing Analysis**

**Study Goal/Aim:** This study aims to characterize the molecular landscape of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) compared to normal macrophages in adjacent tissues using single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). By identifying differentially expressed genes and pathways in TAMs, we seek to enhance our understanding of their role in tumor progression and identify potential therapeutic targets.

**Introduction:** Tumor microenvironments are complex ecosystems where various cell types, including immune cells like macrophages, interact dynamically with cancer cells. TAMs, in particular, exhibit phenotypic plasticity and can exert either pro- or anti-tumor functions depending on their activation state. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TAM heterogeneity is crucial for developing targeted therapies. Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) offers a high-resolution approach to dissect the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells within the tumor microenvironment.

**Study Perspective:** This study adopts a comprehensive bioinformatics approach to unravel the complexity of TAM heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment. By integrating advanced data analysis techniques with biological interpretation, we aim to shed light on the molecular mechanisms driving TAM function and identify novel therapeutic avenues for cancer treatment.
